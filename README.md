# House Price Prediction

The goal here is to predict the price of house using different machine learning algorithms. It is a regression based problem statement. I've used 4 different models and concluded with XGB Regressor doing the best out of all. Main focus was to understand the relationship between the features and the target variable. The accuracy of the models were compared and XGBoost regressor had the best results!
